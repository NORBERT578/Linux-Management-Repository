# **<ins> Virtual Machines.</ins>**
Virtual Machine is a software based emulation of a physical computer that runs its own operating system and applications.

* Virtual machines run on hypervisors that allocate physical resources for example CPU, memory and storage to each guest OS.

* Enables rapid provisioning, scaling and isolation of workloads.

* Ideal for testing Linux environments without dedicated hardware.

## What Is a Cloud Platform ?
Cloud Platform: is an online environment that provides infrastructure, tools and services for developing and managing applications over the internet.

***Key characteristics :***

* ***Scalability*** – resources can be expanded or reduced on demand.

* ***Accessibility*** – services reachable from anywhere with an Internet connection.

* ***Flexibility*** – supports multiple operating systems, languages, and frameworks.

## Benefits of Cloud Platforms.

* ***Reduced hardware costs*** – no need to purchase, maintain, or upgrade physical servers.

* ***Rapid scaling*** – resources can be increased or decreased instantly to match demand.

* ***High availability*** – built‑in redundancy and failover mechanisms.
